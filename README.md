## Description
Our motivation was to create an application through node.js that is able to take in user input and then create a readme file at the end with the user's input displayed in the readme file.
I built this project to display my understanding of node.js, also installing npm's so that I can ask users different questions and use those answers to create files. one npm i used was inquirer and understanding how to use it has made it easier to obtain user input to complete this project.
This project solves the problem of creating a professional readme for a user by asking the user different questions a readme should have and then taking all of that data and displaying it correctly in a readme file.
I learned a lot about node.js and using npms like inquirer to obtain user input and also how to write files I want to create with the user's input.

## Installation
Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download and follow the directions on how to download node for your specific operating system.

## Usage
This application is used in order to create a professional readme with questions that are asked to the user and then using those answers, put them into a readme file for the user.

## Technologies
Node.js, npm, javascript, inquirer.

## Tests
You can test this application by opening an integrated terminal and then putting in the prompt node index, and then the application should start asking you questions to create your readme file.
